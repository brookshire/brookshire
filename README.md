### ðŸ”­ Greetings and Salutations

I'm an HPC Systems Engineer and Master Technologist at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  I've started my career running IT shops, and building websites (Magnet Interactive) before people even knew that was a thing.  I moved on to a startup building and supporting low power, high density servers (RLX Technologies) which was then bought by Hewlett Packard (now Hewlett Packard Enterprise.)  

At HPE, I've built on some networking technologies, then helped build out another high density servers solution named Moonshot and Edgeline.  In 2021, I moved from lower power/high density to...well...the opposite end, joining the Cray group (which was also aquired by HPE) building super comptuers.

### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning and Exploring
