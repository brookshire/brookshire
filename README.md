### ðŸ”­ Greetings and Salutations

I'm an HPC Systems Engineer and Master Technologist at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  I've started my career building and running IT shops, and supporting websites (Magnet Interactive) before people even knew that was a thing.  I moved on to a startup which invented a new class of low power, high density servers called Server Blades (RLX Technologies) which was then bought by Hewlett Packard (now Hewlett Packard Enterprise.)  

At HPE, I continued to build new networking technologies, helped build out more high density server solutions named Moonshot and Edgeline.  In 2021, I made the jumb from lower power/high density to...well...the opposite, joining the Cray high performance computing group building super computers.

### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning and Exploring

* Exploring Open Source Document Management Systems
* Building tools to help HPE's HPC customers to better manage and support their Shasta clusters
